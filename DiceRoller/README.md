# Dice Roller
As part of the assignment, Dice Roller, an application that allows the user to roll one or more dice is implemented.

# Description
This is a native android application which is implemented in Java which meets the below requirements:

1) The interface should allow the user to specify the number of dice to roll.
2) The interface should have a button that allows the user to start a dice roll.
3) Whenever the button is pressed, the application should roll the specified number of dice.
4) The user should also be able to shake the device to start a roll.
5) The dice rolls should be randomly generated.
6) The application should display the results of the roll.
7) The application should allow the user to roll again.

# Design and workflow
The design and workflow of the application is given below:

1) The application is designed with two screens in which one of the screens allows the user to enter the number of dice and other screen allows the user to roll the dice any number of times he/she want.
2) In the first screen, two buttons with "+" and "-" are given for the user to increment and decrement the number of dice. If the user selects any number of dice which is not in between 1 and 6, an error message will be displayed. 
3) A button "Click/shake device to roll" is given for the user so that it navigates to the next screen on click of the button or on shaking the device.
4) Once the second screen appears, the number of dice images which is chosen by the user is displayed. A button is given for the user on click of which, same number of dice are rolled on every click/shake of the device. Total score is displayed every time the dice are rolled.
5) The user can choose to go back to the first screen at any point of the game to change the number of dice and replay the game.

# Known bugs
This application is working well with devices like Pixel 3XL, pixel XL, Nexus 6. For few devices display in the second screen is not proper as the dice are overlapping.
